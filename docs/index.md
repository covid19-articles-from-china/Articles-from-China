# 救人救己! Help Translate COVID-19 Related Articles from China

COVID-19 is out. Let's help! Let's show the world what the Chinese have learned fighting COVID-19, how everyday folks have lived through this.

We need people that are fluent in both Chinese and English to translate COVID-19 related articles. It's okay if you haven't done much translation before. We are not looking for the perfect translation. What's more important right now is to get the information out.

Please email Maggie (maggienj2020 at gmail) if you can help with the translation or review. If you cannot personally help with the translation, please help by sharing this post!
