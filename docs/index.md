# 救人救己! Help Translate Chinese COVID-19 Articles

COVID-19 is out. Let's help! Let's show the world what the Chinese have learned fighting COVID-19, how everyday folks have lived through this.

We need people that are fluent in both Chinese and English to translate COVID-19 related articles. It's okay if you haven't done much translation before. We are not looking for the perfect translation. What's more important right now is to get the information out.

Please email <a href="mail&#116;o&#58;&#37;6D&#97;g%6&#55;i&#37;65%6E%&#54;A202%30%4&#48;gma&#105;l&#46;%&#54;3om" target="_blank" alt="contact us">Maggie</a> if you can help with the translation or review. If you cannot personally help with the translation, please help by sharing this site!
