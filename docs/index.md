# 救人救己! Help Translate COVID-19 Related Articles from China

We have seen what our family and friends are going through. We have studiously followed every story, expert opinion, government decree, meme, and rumor shared on WeChat groups and Weibo. We have donated money, masks, time and effort. How else can we help?

COVID-19 is out. As of right now, multiple countries have reported locally transmitted cases, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Iran, Italy… Let’s help! Let’s show the world what the Chinese have learned in the last two months. How we went from confusion, panic, anger, and desperation to mostly calmly waiting out the quarantine. Let’s show the world the complexity behind the diagnosis and reporting, the lessons learned in implementing different levels of quarantine. Let’s show the world how everyday folks have lived through this, the love and kindness, the sacrifice, the unbearable loss, and despite it all, the abundance of humor.

There is also a “selfish” reason that we need to do this. There are a lot of misinformation about the situation and the Chinese out there. We can help ameliorate the biases by giving the real Chinese people and media (yes there are quality journalism in China too) a voice on the world stage.

We need people that are fluent in both Chinese and English to translate COVID-19 related articles from China. It’s okay if you haven’t done much translation before. We are not looking for the perfect translation. Prose is great, but what's more important right now is the information. We need to get it out!

Please email Maggie (maggienj2020 at gmail) if you can help with the translation. If you cannot personally help with the translation, please help by sharing this post!
