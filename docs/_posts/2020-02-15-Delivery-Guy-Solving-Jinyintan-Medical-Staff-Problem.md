blurb: At nightfall, I closed the warehouse and went home for a family get together dinner. At 10PM I saw a nurse from Jinyintan Hospital posted a request, saying "Please help, no cars are allowed here, buses and metros are not running, I can't go home, it takes 4 hours to walk home". It was posted at 6pm and nobody responded.
