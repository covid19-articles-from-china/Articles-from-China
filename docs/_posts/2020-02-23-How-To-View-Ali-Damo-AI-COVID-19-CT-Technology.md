**OP (original poster) is a student of radiology. I actually have always worried about the possibility of AI replacing doctors. After all, this is a career that depends on experience, and this is exactly where AI has such an advantage, where it can continously and rapidly learn given current data. With this approach the speed and cost of training a radiologist are both way lower than the current approach, and this "radiologist" even has a great accuracy (reaching 96% according to news).**

**Meanwhile I'd also like to ask, if (my profession) is to be replaced, how shall I proceed down this career path for the future?**
