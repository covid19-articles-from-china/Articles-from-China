**OP (original poster) is a student of radiology. I actually have always worried about the possibility of AI replacing doctors. After all, this is a career that depends on experience, and this is exactly where AI has such an advantage, where it can continously and rapidly learn given current data. With this approach the speed and cost of training a radiologist are both way lower than the current approach, and this "radiologist" even has a great accuracy (reaching 96% according to news).**


**Meanwhile I'd also like to ask, if (my profession) is to be replaced, how shall I proceed down this career path in the future?**

职业相关：武汉协和医院麻醉医生，新冠肺炎疫情一线。

一句话概括：成熟且能投入临床的医疗AI技术，对超负荷运转的疫情一线来说，是应对诊疗人力紧缺的及时雨。

本人报名麻醉插管突击队，到协和医院西院区支援有一周余。

说实话，西区这边堪称“惨烈”的危重病患救治场面，让我久久难以忘怀。

新冠肺炎恶化速度之快，重症者衰竭之迅速，是超过许多资深临床医生预料的。比如我昨天随访的5名前日插管病人中，两位已不幸逝世…

我清晰的记得，这两人插管前还有意识，一个老爹爹还能和我们讲几句话…
