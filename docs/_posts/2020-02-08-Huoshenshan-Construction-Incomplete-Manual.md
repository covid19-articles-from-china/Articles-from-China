First, you need an urgent order: the China Construction Third Bureau shall lead, and Wuhan Construction Engineering, Wuhan Municipal Administration, Hanyang District Administration and other enterprises shall participate in the construction, commanding 7,500 workers and nearly a thousand sets of machineries and equipments, making a solemn promise to all Chinese people and the tormented Wuhan residents -- "Ten days, build a life-saving hospital with a capacity of 1,000 beds".

Then you need Beijing Zhongyuan International Engineering Design and Research Institute to finish organizing the design and construction drawings of Xiaotangshan Hospital from 17 years ago in 78 minutes, then hand them over to Wuhan CITIC Architectural Design Institute without reservation, and Dr. Huang Xizhen, the national survey and design master, to repeatedly remind you of the lessons learned.


You need CITIC Architectural Design Institute to assemble 60 designers in one hour, set up a non-profit project, contact hundreds of BIM designers across the country to participate, and go all out to battle: come up with a design plan within 24 hours, and finalize construction drawings in consultation with the construction unit within 60 hours.

You need Wuhan Hangfa Group to quickly enter the site to begin site leveling, road and drainage engineering construction. At the same time, the emergency engineering construction team composed of GeoEnviron, Oriental Yuhong, Xingyuan Environment, Yinjiang Environmental Protection and other leading companies in the industry to be responsible for the construction of anti-seepage projects, sewage treatment and medical waste transfer facilities; it is also necessary to summon the China Railway Heavy Industry Corporation, a subsidiary of China Railway Industry Corporation, and the 11th and 14th bureaus of China Railway Construction to rapidly increase their support to catch up with the construction at the most difficult time.

Then you can set up a camera behind the three osmanthus trees to start live streaming, and summon tens of millions of cloud supervisors, watching the cement trucks from Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion, and Xugong Machinery busy working 24 hours a day.

You need PetroChina on-site refueling vehicles, and requisition Sinopec Zhiyin Avenue gas station to ensure fuel supply for the project site, while also providing instant noodles, boiling water, meeting venues and temporary toilets.

You need all the production staff of Ezhou Power Plant of China Three Gorges Group to station on the site to ensure power supply for Wuhan; China Railway Construction Express to give priority to the release of materials for Huoshenshan Hospital; Baowu Steel, Southern Building Materials, Minmetals Development to supply steel; and China National Building Material to provide gypsum board, keel.

Finally, let the professional team install the Gree air conditioner, and wait for Haier's engineers to arrive at the scene with refrigerators on their backs because of road closure, and place the Midea water dispensers and water heaters in place. Outside the door, dozens of negative-pressure ambulances donated by Yutong Bus and Jiangling Group are ready to go.

When you think of it, someone will always provide it in time; if you don't think of it, someone will provide it too.

Filing cabinets worth 200,000 yuan, 14 Luoyang furniture companies rushed to work overnight, and told you after delivery, "don't pay, we donate."

Eight thousand kg of winter melons, Shanghai greens, and cilantro were driven 300 kilometers by veteran Wang Hui from Baiji Town, Shenqiu, Henan, and delivered directly to the construction site on Chinese New Year’s Eve.

One ton of "Zizhong Blood Oranges" were carefully selected and sent by Huang Cheng, a peasant from Shuinan Town, Zizhong County, Sichuan, who is not rich.

The 400 benches were donated by Jin Chen, a Taobao shop owner who had been in business for less than a year, and could not bear to see the workers who rushed to work day and night could only sit on the ground.

There is no such thing as “infrastructural madness", only the race against the clock. No need for "shock, applause", just press on with clenched teeth, and never give up.

Hold your breath and endure the pain. The dragon in the village will offer you the hardest scales, even if he is already scarred.

Wuhan, hold on.
