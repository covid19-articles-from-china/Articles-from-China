blurb: On Jan 24th, at noon, the COVID-19 Prevention and Control Headquarter in Wuhan announced the implementation of the graded treatment policy for the novel pneumonia. Patients with a fever will be first sent to the community health care center for screening and categorization, and then sent to higher-level hospitals. But for some patients, the problem becomes even more difficult.
