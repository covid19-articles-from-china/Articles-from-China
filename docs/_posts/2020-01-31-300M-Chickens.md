blurb: When hot topics on hardcore "speeches" by village secretaries as well as local-flavoured banners and slogans calling for fight against SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) sweep across the Internet, attention shall also be paid to the winding roads in the farm fields, and this is a part of ensuring a functioning social system.
