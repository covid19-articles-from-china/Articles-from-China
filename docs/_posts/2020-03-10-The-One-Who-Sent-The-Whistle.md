blurb: On December 30, 2019, Affin received a virus test report for patients with unknown pneumonia. She circled the word "SARS coronavirus" in red. When asked by a college classmate, she took the report and circulated it, to this classmate who is also a doctor. That night, the report spread to doctor circles in Wuhan, and those who forwarded the report included the eight doctors who were disciplined by the police.
