Securing the support of various parties, the "Fire Eye Lab", a testing facility matched with "Huoshenshan Hospital", was built within a few days. But after the daily testing capacity of BGI increased to 10,000 cases, the daily samples they received barely reached over 1,000. The team could finish testing the samples sent over the previous night by noon, and the capacity idle rate was as high as 80%.
